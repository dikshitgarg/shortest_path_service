This repo contains solution to find the optimal route

Brute force algorithm with dynamic programming:

Brute force:
Brute force algorithm says to compute the cost of every possible tour. This means to try all the combination of nodes in which it is traversing all the nodes. The path or route which traverse each and every city is known as Hamiltonian cycle.
Time taken: O(n!)

Dynamic programming:
Dynamic programming came into picture for improve the time complexity
Time complexity changes from O(n!) to O(n^2)(2^n)
